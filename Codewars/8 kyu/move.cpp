/*
In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice 
and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.

Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the
hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
*/

// My Solution
int move(int position, int roll) {
    int move(int position, int roll) {
    return roll * 2 + position;
}
}
